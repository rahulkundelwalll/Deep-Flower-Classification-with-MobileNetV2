# Flower Classification with MobileNetV2



## Overview

This deep learning project is focused on classifying 104 different flower species using a pretrained MobileNetV2 model. The project utilizes a large dataset in TFRecord format, which is converted into images and labels for training. Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve model performance.

## Pretrained Model

We leverage the MobileNetV2 architecture pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. The pretrained model's weights are fine-tuned for flower classification.

## Data Preprocessing

- Conversion of TFRecord data into images and labels.
- Data augmentation techniques applied to increase dataset diversity.
- Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Training

- The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Transfer learning is employed, with the pretrained MobileNetV2 model as the base.
- Training parameters:
  - Learning rate: 0.001
  - Batch size: 32
  - Number of epochs: 100
  - Loss function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
  - Optimizer: Adam

## Evaluation

- Model performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset.
- Metrics used for evaluation:
  - Accuracy
- The trained model achieves an accuracy of 82% on the test set.

## Inference

- You can use the trained model for flower classification by running the provided inference script.
- Example usage: `python inference.py --image input.jpg`

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
